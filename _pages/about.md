I am a senior student majoring in applied mathematics at Peking University (PKU) while pursuing a double major in computer science. I am doing undergraduate research about machine learning theory especially deep learning theory advised by Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/wangliwei). I am mostly interested on the theory that can inspire us make better algorithms. I spent a wonderful summer at MIT as a research intern supervised by Professor [Sasha Rakhlin](http://www.mit.edu/~rakhlin/) in 2019. I am also fortunate to work with Professor [Jason D. Lee](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~lee715/).

**I will apply for Ph.D this year!**

# **Publications**

- ### **(Preprint)** [**A Gram-Gauss-Newton Method Learning Overparameterized Deep Neural Networks for Regression Problems**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11675)

  ***Tianle Cai**\*, Ruiqi Gao\*, Jikai Hou\*, Siyu Chen, Dong Wang, Di He, Zhihua Zhang, Liwei Wang*

  **Highlight: A provable second-order optimization method for overparameterized network on regression problem! As light as SGD at each iteration but converge much faster than SGD for real world application.**

- ### **(Preprint)** [**Adversarially Robust Generalization Just Requires More Unlabeled Data**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00555)

  *Runtian Zhai\*, **Tianle Cai\***, Di He, Chen Dan, Kun He, John Hopcroft, Liwei Wang*

  **Highlight: Though robust generalization need more data, we show that just more unlabeled data is enough by both theory and experiments!**

- ### **(NeurIPS 2019 *Spotlight*)** [**Convergence of Adversarial Training in Overparametrized Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07916)

  *Ruiqi Gao\*, **Tianle Cai\***, Haochuan Li, Liwei Wang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jason D. Lee*

  **Highlight: For overparameterized neural network, we prove that adversarial training can converge to global minima (with loss 0).**
